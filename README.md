# Hospital-Management-System-RMI

This is a Hospital Management System using Java RMI. This is a deliverable for the module Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing. The General Doctor client side of the applicaton was implemented by me. The rest was distributed among teammates.

Purpose of the project was to demonstrate **RMI**

## Source Code:
1. HospitalImplementations folder is the server implementation of the system. It needs to be run as a separate project.
2. The remaining files are the source code for the client side of the system.
3. hospital_system.sql is the DB dump to restore DB

## Teammates:

2. Yuvraj Seegolam
3. Jason Henri
4.  Adel Rose
